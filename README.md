## kanji test replacement thoughts
Now we probably don't want to score how well we do each week.
(If we really wanted, we could do a monthly test the old way
just to check that anki is really working.)

Instead of 20 words to test per week, we should do something like
10 minutes of anki instead. Ideally, we should be doing anki practice
a couple of times a week, but these 10 minutes are always allocated to 
getting in more practice. 

(I guess if you've done all your cards, then free time...)


## using the anki deck
It'll also be good to include any new grammar patterns/vocab as anki cards.

## todo
- setup 3-way cards for Kanji/Hiragana/English
- setup kanji plugin if needed
